1.Reveals Data Trends: Helps understand relationships between variables.

2.Model Choice: Balances simplicity (linear) and complexity (polynomial).

3.Overfitting: Too complex; captures noise, poor generalization.

4.Underfitting: Too simple; misses key patterns.

5.Evaluation: Use metrics like R-squared to assess fit quality.

6.Applications: Useful for prediction, smoothing, interpolation, and extrapolation.
